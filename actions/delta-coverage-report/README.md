# Delta Coverage Report GitHub Action

The action renders a delta coverage report in the pull request comment. 
Also, the report is rendered in the workflow summary.

## Inputs

- `message` (optional): The message to display in the comment. Default is `''`(empty).
- `delta-coverage-report`: The path to the delta coverage markdown report file.
- `github-token` (optional): The GitHub token to use for authentication.

If `title` is not blank then the previous comment generated by this action will be updated with the new report,
otherwise a new comment will be created.
