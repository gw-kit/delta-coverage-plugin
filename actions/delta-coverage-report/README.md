# Delta Coverage Report GitHub Action

The action creates check run with detailed coverage info based on the Delta-Coverage summary report.
Also, the action creates a comment in the pull request with links to the check runs.

## Inputs

- `title` (optional): The title of the comment. Default is `Delta Coverage Check`.
- `summary-report-path`: The path to the Delta-Coverage summary report json file.
- `suppress-check-failures` (optional): Suppress check run failures.
   If a PR contains label `suppress-delta-coverage` then the default value is `true`, otherwise `false`.
   Can be useful when you want to ignore coverage check failures.
- `github-token` (optional): The GitHub token to use for authentication.

If `title` is not blank then the previous comment generated by this action will be updated with the new report,
otherwise a new comment will be created.
