### Breaking changes
- Base report directory is changed from `build/reports/jacoco/deltaCoverage` to `build/reports/coverage-reports`.
- `jacocoExecFiles` property of `DeltaCoverageConfiguration` extension is renamed to `coverageBinaryFiles`.
- Now auto-applying of JaCoCo(or Kover) plugin is configured via the Delta Coverage plugin extension:
  ```kts
  // kotlin gradle dsl 
  configure<DeltaCoverageConfiguration> {
    coverage {
        engine = CoverageEngine.JACOCO // Default is 'JACOCO'.
        autoApplyPlugin = true // Default is 'true'.
    } 
  }
  ```
  Auto-applying via a project property `io.github.surpsg.delta-coverage.auto-apply-jacoco` is removed.
- Removed deprecated properties from `DeltaCoverageConfiguration` extension:
  - `minLines`
  - `minBranches`
  - `minInstructions`
  See README for the new API.
